# What is Selenium
Selenium is one of the most widely used open source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite.It was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004 as an internal tool at Thought Works. Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms and programming languages.
Selenium can be easily deployed on platforms such as Windows, Linux, Solaris and Macintosh. Moreover, it supports OS (Operating System) for mobile applications like iOS, windows mobile and android.
Selenium supports a variety of programming languages through the use of drivers specific to each language.Languages supported by Selenium include C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.Currently, Selenium Web driver is most popular with Java and C#. Selenium test scripts can be coded in any of the supported programming languages and can be run directly in most modern web browsers. Browsers supported by Selenium include Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari.

# Automation Testing
Automation testing uses the specialized tools to automate the execution of manually designed test cases without any human intervention. Automation testing tools can access the test data, controls the execution of tests and compares the actual result against the expected result. Consequently, generating detailed test reports of the system under test.
Automation testing covers both functional and performance test on an application.
# Test Automation for Web Applications

If we take a look at the type of software applications prevailing in current market scenario, most of the software applications are written as web-based applications to be run in an internet browser. The testing strategy for web-based applications varies widely among companies and organizations.In an era of highly interactive and responsive software processes where many organizations are using some form of agile methodology, test automation is frequently becoming a requirement for software projects.

# Download WebDriver:
Selenium WebDriver is the most important component of Selenium Tool's Suite. 
Most commonly used WebDriver's include:
Google Chrome Driver
Internet Explorer Driver
Opera Driver
Safari Driver

# Google WebDriver:
Chrome browser implements the WebDriver protocol using an executable called ChromeDriver.exe. This executable start a server on your system which in turn is responsible for running your test scripts in Selenium.

### To download the correct version of ChromeDriver for your system, you can follow these steps:

Open your web browser and go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org.
On the ChromeDriver website, locate the section for downloading ChromeDriver.
Choose the appropriate version of ChromeDriver based on your Chrome browser version and operating system.
Click on the download link to download the ChromeDriver executable file.
Once the download is complete, extract the downloaded file if necessary.
Ensure that the ChromeDriver executable is accessible and its location is known, as you'll need to specify this location in your Selenium code.
